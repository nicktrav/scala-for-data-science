Before Java 8, there was no [mixin composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin) capability in Java, where composition is generally [preferred over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance). \n\nImagine that you want to define reusable logging code and mix it into other classes declaratively. Before Java 8, you could define the abstraction for logging in an interface, but you had to use some ad hoc mechanism to implement it (like implementing all methods to delegate to a helper object). Java 8 added the ability to provide default method definitions, as well as declarations in interfaces. This makes mixin composition easier, but you still can't add fields (for state), so the capability is limited. \n\nScala traits fully support mixin composition by supporting both field and method definitions with flexibility rules for overriding behavior, once the traits are mixed into classes."

Unification of Primitives and Types\nIn Java, there is a clear distinction between primitives, which are nice for performance (you can put them in registers, you can pass them on the stack, you don't heap allocate them), and instances of classes, which give you the expressiveness of OOP, but with the overhead of heap allocation, etc.\n\nScala unifies the syntax, but in most cases, compiles optimal code. So, for example, `Float` acts like any other type, e.g., `String`, with methods you call, but the compiler uses JVM `float` primitives. `Float` and the other primitives are subtypes of `AnyVal` and include `Byte`, `Short`, `Int`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `Char`, `Boolean`, and `Unit`.\n\nAnother benefit is that the uniformity extends to parameterized types, like collections. If you implement your own `Tree[T]` type, `T` can be `Float`, `String`, `MyMassiveClass`, whatever. There's no mental burden of explicitly boxing and unboxing primitives.\n\nHowever, the downside is that your primitives will be boxed when used in a context like this. Scala does have an annotation `@specialized(a,b,c)` that's used to tell the compiler to generate optimal implementations for the primitives listed for `a,b,c`, but it's not a perfect solution."

Two examples from Scala are `Option[T]` and its allowed subtypes `Some[T]` and `None`, and `Either[L,R]` and its subtypes `Left[L]` and `Right`[R]`.\n\nNote that `Option[T]` represents two and only two possible states, either I have something, a `T` inside a `Some[T]`, or I don't anything, a `None`. There are no additional \"states\" that are logically possible for the `Option[T]` \"abstraction\". Similarly, `Either[L,R]` encapsulates a similar dichotomy, often used for \"failure\" (e.g., `Left[Throwable]` by convention) and \"successful result\" (`Right[T]` for some \"expected\" `T`).\n\nThe term _sum type_ comes from an analog between types and arithmetic. For `Option`, the number of allowed intances (ignoring the type parameter `T`) is just the sum, _two_. Similarly for `Either`.\n\nThere are also _product types_, like tuples, where combining types together _multiples_ the number of instances. For example, a tuple of `(Option,Either)` would have 2*2 instances. A tuple `(Boolean,Option,HTTP_Commands)` has 2*2*7 possible instances (there are 7 HTTP 1.1 commands, like `GET`, `POST`, etc.)\n\nScala uses type hierarchies for sum types, where an abstract _sealed_ trait or class is used for the base type, e.g., `Option[T]` and `Either[L,R]`, and subtypes represent the concrete types. The `sealed` keyword is used on the base type and it is crucial; it tells the compiler to only allow subtypes to be defined in the same _file_, which means users can't add their own subtypes, breaking the logic of the type.\n\nSome other languages implement sum types using a variation of _enumerations_. Java has that, but it's a much more limited concept than true subtypes."

However, its design has some subtleties that make the behavior not straightforward when `nulls` are involved. For details, see [this blog post](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/08/optional-broken/)."

    "source" : "### 9J: Definition-site Variance vs. Call-site Variance\nThis is a technical point. In Java, when you define a type with a type parameter, like our `SuccessOrFailure[T]` previously, to hold items of some type `T`, you can't specify in the declaration whether it's okay to substitute a subtype of `SuccessOrFailure` with a subtype of `T`. For example, is the following okay?:\n\n```java\n// Java\nSuccessOrFailure<Object> sof = null;\n...\nsof = new Success<String>(\"foo\");\n```\n\nThis substitutability is called _variance_, referring to the variance allowed in `T` if we use a subtype of the outer type, `SuccessOrFailure`. Notice that we want to assign a subclass of `SuccessOrFailure` _and_ a subtype of `Object`. In this case, we're doing _covariant substitution_, because the subtyping \"moves in the same direction\", from parent to child for both types. There's also _contravariant_, where the type parameter moves \"up\" while the outer type moves \"down\", and _invariant_ typing, where you can't change the type parameter. That is, in the invariant case, we could only assign `Success<Object>(...)` to `sof`.\n\nJava does not let the type _designer_ specify the correct behavior. This means Java forces the _user_ of the type to specify the variance at the _call site_:\n\n```java\nSuccessOrFailure<? extends Object> sof = null;\n...\nsof = new Success<String>(\"foo\");\n\n```\nThis is harder for the user, who has to understand what's okay in this case, both what the designer intended and some technical rules of type theory. \n\nIt's much better if the _designer_ of `SuccessOrFailure[T]`, who understands the desired behavior, defines the allowed variance behavior at the _definition site_, which Scala supports. Recall from above:\n\n```scala\n// Scala\nsealed trait SuccessOrFailure[+Result]  \ncase class   Success[Result](result: Result)  extends SuccessOrFailure[Result]\ncase class   Failure(error: RuntimeException) extends SuccessOrFailure[Nothing]\n\n...\n// usage:\nval sof: SuccessOrFailure[AnyRef] = new Success[String](\"Yea!\")\n```"

    "source" : "### 9K: Value Classes\nScala's built-in _value types_ `Int`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `Boolean`, and `Unit` are implemented with the corresponding JVM primitive values, eliminating the overhead of allocating an instance on the heap. What if you define a class that wraps _one_ of these values?\n```scala\nclass Celsius(value: Float) {\n  // methods\n}\n```\n  Unfortunately, instances are allocated on the heap, even though all instance \"state\" is held by a single primitive `Float`. Scala now has an `AnyVal` trait. If you use it as a parent of types like `Celsius`, they will enjoy the same optimization that the built-in value types enjoy. That is, the single primitive field (`value` here) will be pushed on the stack, etc., and no instance of `Celsius` will be heap allocated, _in most cases._\n```scala\nclass Celsius(value: Float) extends AnyVal {\n  // methods\n}\n```\n\nSo, why doesn't Scala make this optimization automatically? There are some limitations, which are described [here](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/value-classes.html) and in [my book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033073.do)."

For example, a database connection is expensive.\n```scala\nlazy val jdbcConnection = new JDBCConnection(...)\n```\nUse the `lazy` keyword to delay initialization until it's actually needed (if ever). This feature can also be used to solve some tricky \"order of initialization\" problems. It has one drawback; there will be extra overhead for every access to check if it has already been initialized, so don't do this if the value will be read a lot. A future version of Scala will remove this overhead."

Imagine you write the following code in the REPL:\n```scala\nscala> val massiveArray = get8GBarray(...)\nscala> // do some work\nscala> massiveArray = getDifferent8GBarray(...)\n```\nYou might think that the first \"8GB array\" will be nicely garbage collected when you reassign `massiveArray`. Not so. Here's a simplified view of the code the REPL generates for the _last_ line to pass to the compiler.\n\n```scala\nclass LineN {\n  class LineN_minus_1 {\n    class LineN_minus_2 {\n      ...\n        class Line1 {\n          val massiveArray = get8GBarray(...)\n        }\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n  val massiveArray = getDifferent8GBarray(...)\n}\n```\nWhy? The JVM expects classes to be compiled into byte code, so the REPL synthesizes classes for each line you evaluate (or group of lines when you use the `:paste ... ^D` feature).\n\nNote that the overridden `massiveArray` shadows the original one, which is the trick the REPL uses to let you redefine variables, which would be prohibited by the compiler otherwise. Unfortunately, that leaves the shadowed reference attached to old data, so it can't be garbage collected, even though the REPL provides no way to ever refer to it again!"
